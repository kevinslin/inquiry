I have a tricorder in my pocket. When an idea pops in my head, or I spot something in the wild I want to remember, what can I do?

I can:

- Take a photo/video

- Take a voice memo (or use an app I'm working on...)

- Google it/put it into my tabs

- Write a temporal reminder/calendar event

- Write a note (maybe append to an existing one if I can find it quickly)

But I can't practically do anything more. If I want to annotate something, or link it with prior media, what can I do?

Scrapbooking is impossible in the age of camera rolls. I don't want to type anything either and interrupt my flow.

Is this what machine learning is for? Smart capture?

Facebook had the "Moments" app and I think Google Area 120 had a few one-off apps with this "alternate camera roll" energy.

I want Google Lens/Live Text but with the context of my prior captures. Need more connective tissue.
