Some of the most important problems are being tackled in academic biology labs. They seem like a suitable [serious context of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Effective_system_design_requires_insights_drawn_from_serious_contexts_of_use) to invent powerful new representations and tools and help improve public health.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1453423907898232836?s=21\n\nI'm considering reaching out to bio labs across the country and volunteering (for a small stipend) to be a \"resident toolbuilder\". Not just to solve immediate digital problems for the lab but to examine and improve their processes and accessibility for everyone. Perhaps down the road I can generalize one lab's tooling into a more universal platform ([[projects.figma-science]]).\n\nTwo caveats to look out for:\n\n- The \"faster horse\" problem: will labs be biased towards conventional tools and just want me to do plumbing? Assuming plumbing is actually the biggest bottleneck, maybe I can do something to improve productivity there. Do they even know what they need in general? It would be best if I could observe (a la [Laboratory Life](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691028323/laboratory-life)) what they're doing and act from there, using my own imagination.\n- Accruing technical debt: I don't want to leave the lab in more of a mess than it started, with rapidly-rotting bespoke frontends that will end up in the trash quickly. Ideally I build an oeuvre that is either very easy for the lab to maintain, or is so cohesive and compelling that I can maintain it myself as a \"platform\".\n\nIn general I'm becoming more biased in favor of building for \"hard tech\" for urgent problems in the world (I resonated with [Kevin Lynagh's post](https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2021_01_important_work/) on important work). Effective altruism is another realm I'm adjacent to and very much a supporter of.\n\nI incidentally discovered [Bret Victor considered](https://postlight.com/podcast/computing-is-everywhere) going this route early in his career:\n\n> I saw climate change as this crisis and one of the most important things to work on. And I’d — I’d tried to work directly on that in certain ways and realized that I just didn’t really have the kind of temperment for going really deep on a scientific problem. I was more of a toolmaker. I wanted to make tools that enabled other people to rally other people in the problem. Even before Apple I had come up with this plan of, “Well, I wanna make this really powerful scientific tool. I don’t really know enough of how science is practiced. And so I’m going to like travel around the country, spending a month at a different scie — a different lab um every month. Just kind of offering myself as like, “I’m a free toolmaker, use me how you will.” And then thereby kind of get — get the experience of um after a year of like, “Oh here’s the sorts of needs that scientists have and here is the super tool that I can make.” That plan didn’t really get off the ground because um it turns out I’m not really social enough to reach out to people actively like that.\n\n> I went through this period of traveling around and kind of coming up with these themes. But in the process of doing that, I uh — a team of scientists at um at Georgia Tech and um did some prototyping with them. And the structures that I came up with and the enthusiasm that they had for them made me think, kinda go back to that, “Hey, I really wanna make a tool for scientists. I wanna make a new MatLab or a cross between MatLab and Garageband.” And so that was um I’ve never admitted this publicly before but that was kind of my — my major project for like the next year or two after that was I was making this um this new scientific tool.\n\n> It’s hard to have the level of motivation to pull off something really huge like that, if you don’t have the right support structures in place.\n\nhttps://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology/\n\nFun random example: Chaim Gingold & Shawn Douglas's [Gelbox](https://douglaslab.org/gelbox/)\n\nRelated: [[projects.figma-science]]\n\nKevin suggests commercial labs \"get more done\" - just a matter of being good about IP transfer.\n","url":"https://a9.io/inquiry/notes/UzCKP637yqfdSpsFfin9x.html","relUrl":"notes/UzCKP637yqfdSpsFfin9x.html"},{"doc":"Quick Capture Is Under-Explored","title":"Quick Capture Is Under-Explored","hpath":"theory.quick-capture","content":"\nI have a tricorder in my pocket.

They destroy existing abstractions. And they're fast and delightful.\n\nThis means no Webkit, Electron, or V8.\n\nEvanw's [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#why-is-esbuild-fast):\n\n> **Everything in esbuild is written from scratch.**\n> There are a lot of performance benefits with writing everything yourself instead of using 3rd-party libraries. You can have performance in mind from the beginning, you can make sure everything uses consistent data structures to avoid expensive conversions, and you can make wide architectural changes whenever necessary. The drawback is of course that it's a lot of work.\n> For example, many bundlers use the official TypeScript compiler as a parser. But it was built to serve the goals of the TypeScript compiler team and they do not have performance as a top priority. Their code makes pretty heavy use of megamorphic object shapes and unnecessary dynamic property accesses (both well-known JavaScript speed bumps). And the TypeScript parser appears to still run the type checker even when type checking is disabled. None of these are an issue with esbuild's custom TypeScript parser.\n\n## Some systems\n\n- [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)\n- [Xi Editor](https://raphlinus.github.io/xi/2020/06/27/xi-retrospective.html) (RIP?)\n- [Volt](https://volt-app.com/) (and [V language](https://vlang.io/))\n- [Ripcord](https://cancel.fm/ripcord/)\n- [**Playbit**](https://playb.it/) - [podcast episode](https://museapp.com/podcast/27-playful-software/)\n- [Nova](https://nova.app/) - no Vim emulation? wtf!\n- [Neovim?](https://neovim.io/)\n- Raft (vs Paxos)\n\n**Observation**: Rewrites of large systems by tiny teams are powerful. Conway's law and all that.\n\nIn general, if something's rewritten in Go or Rust, it's probably faster. Not necessarily because the language is faster (Go is garbage collected!) but because the languages provide the clarity of thought needed to redesign a system, safely, from scratch.\n\nGreat counterpoint to this: Joel Spolsky calls rewrites a “[thing you should never do](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)” because code is not a physical object. It doesn’t get rusty or get clean. While you might have more clarity the second time around, you won’t necessarily have fewer bugs or time consumed.

Particularly early on, you may not be able to articulate the new element you’re reaching for very clearly. It may just sound like an unusual adverb choice or an innocuous-seeming qualifier. Others’ replies will tend to emphasize the most mainstream elements, since they may not notice or know how to react to the aspects you least understand. Such conversation will often drag you back towards the mainstream. It’s a kind of “regression to the mean” for ideas.\n\n> Great colleagues and collaborators can take more active steps to mitigate the issue. For instance, if Michael hears me talking about some idea that seems fairly banal on the surface, he’ll deliberately tug at the vague spots where I’m straining to reach past typical interpretations. This was part of a broader practice he called “listening for enablement.” My Khan Academy research colleague May-Li Khoe would respond to my poorly-understood ideas by riffing in unpredictable directions. Her sketches would often explore wildly different paths, but those vivid reactions often helped me understand my own inklings better. Unfortunately, I’m not yet sure how to avoid the regression problem when discussing ideas regularly with a broad audience.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Talk about anything with anyone and have a system that is an active participant in molding all of that information into docs, processes, automations, even apps and products.

We evolved to scan.\n\n- Text and grids are fundamentally predictable and unsurprising.\n\n  - They're boring.\n  - Paragraphs are cubicles.\n\n- What if we had a plurality of pathways?\n  - Conveying a journey.

([[text.reading]])\n\nWhen essays involve visual components, your eyes will be attracted to them, like basins in a pool. In conventional articles, there's a stark contrast between an eye-catching figure and a big fat chunk of prose in an attentional vector field.
