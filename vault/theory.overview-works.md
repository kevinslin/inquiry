When you are building a system, you first do an overview of prior work. Academics do this a lot in a formal sense, to motivate their system by identifying gaps.

Augmenting human intellect was written 6 years before the mother of all demos!

> where berkeley is like "we think X is important" (where X = the cloud or whatever) and then executes a 5 year plan to do lots of X research
