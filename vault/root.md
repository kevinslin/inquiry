This is [Max Krieger](https://a9.io)'s "inquiry" page. I guess it's like a [Digital Garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). But I'm not trying to upload my Second Brain to it. Just want to share some half-baked ideas. One source of inspiration for this was Kevin Lynagh's ["Collaboration ideas"](https://kevinlynagh.com/ideas/).

It was made with [Dendron](https://dendron.so).

Take everything I write here (well, everywhere) with a grain of salt. That said I'm always happy to talk about anything on here.

The pages definitely don't adhere to [Andy's Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) pattern.

Feel free to add [a PR or issue to the repo](https://github.com/maxkrieger/inquiry) to discuss any of these in public!
