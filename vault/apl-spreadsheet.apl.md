It's a REPL interface, and a really old one. But it's all about performing abstract operations on concrete data. Reminds me of [PANE](http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/)'s philosophy: "programming with visible data".

The weird runic incantations like [`r←,⍳⊢ ⋄ (r G) ≡ r ∘.{⍺[⍵]}⍨ ↓r G`](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/50_12.htm) are super charming as well. Sure it's intimidating to look at, but the semantics could perhaps be turned into direct manipulation semantics ([[interaction-semantics]])?
