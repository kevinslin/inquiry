> Good books are almost fractally deep: you find whole worlds wherever you look, and no matter how far in you zoom. Breaking a book into multiple meetings makes the most of this fact. It gives you space to dwell — on a page, even on a single word — without feeling like you’re wasting anyone’s time. No: that’s what a book club is for, not to sum up what you’ve read but to live inside it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How a deep reading club works:<br><br>Someone chooses a book &amp; invites a group to read it. You read together, aloud, taking the time it takes to read &amp; absorb the text. You annotate the text together, then your annotations become the catalysts for whatever conversation comes next.</p>&mdash; Ḟreyjạ (@utotranslucence) <a href="https://twitter.com/utotranslucence/status/1285415898707226624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Co audiobook listening? Podcasts? But how to handle forking?
